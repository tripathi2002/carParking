Creating modules
• UI: This module gives directives that could be used by other projects such as
alert, accordion, modal, tab, and tooltip.
• Search: The search engine we created to filter cars could also be separated as
an individual library and reused in other places.
• Parking: This is the parking application itself, with its own resources such as
views, controllers, directives, filters, and services.
